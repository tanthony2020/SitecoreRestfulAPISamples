# SitecoreRestfulAPISamples
This is samples of using Sitecore RestfulAPI C# 

I decided to create this REPO because I had to re-write old sitecore 8.2 import processes for sitecore 9.3 and rather than using the GetDatabase methods I used the RestfulAPI. I couldn't find any C# samples out there so I decided to put it out there how to do it.

The purpose of this is not to be able to run this applicaiton but to see the code as a sample.
